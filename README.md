## Why VibeTunnel?

Ever wanted to check on your AI agents while you're away? Need to monitor that long-running build from your phone? Want to share a terminal session with a colleague without complex SSH setups? VibeTunnel makes it happen with zero friction.

**"We wanted something that just works"** - That's exactly what we built.

## The Story

VibeTunnel was born from a simple frustration: checking on AI agents remotely was way too complicated. During an intense coding session, we decided to solve this once and for all. The result? A tool that makes terminal access as easy as opening a web page.
