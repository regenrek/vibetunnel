## Why VibeTunnel?

Ever wanted to check on your AI agents while you're away? Need to monitor that long-running build from your phone? Want to share a terminal session with a colleague without complex SSH setups? VibeTunnel makes it happen with zero friction.

**"We wanted something that just works"** - That's exactly what we built.

## The Story

VibeTunnel was born from a simple frustration: checking on AI agents remotely was way too complicated. During an intense coding session, we decided to solve this once and for all. The result? A tool that makes terminal access as easy as opening a web page.

Prefix any command with `vt` to make it accessible in your browser:
```bash
# Monitor AI agents
vt claude

# Run development servers
vt npm run dev

# Watch long-running processes
vt python train_model.py

# Or just open a shell
vt --shell
```

### 4. Open Your Dashboard

Visit [http://localhost:4020](http://localhost:4020) to see all your terminal sessions in the browser.

## Real-World Use Cases

### ü§ñ AI Development
Monitor and control AI coding assistants like Claude Code remotely. Perfect for checking on agent progress while you're away from your desk.

```bash
vt claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Remote Development
Access your development environment from anywhere. No more "I need to check something on my work machine" moments.

```bash
vt code .
vt npm run dev
```

### üìä System Monitoring
Keep an eye on system resources, logs, or long-running processes from any device.

```bash
vt htop
vt tail -f /var/log/system.log
```

### üéì Teaching & Collaboration
Share terminal sessions with colleagues or students in real-time through a simple web link.

## Remote Access Options

### Option 1: Tailscale (Recommended)
1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on your Mac and remote device
2. Access VibeTunnel at `http://[your-mac-name]:4020` from anywhere on your Tailnet

### Option 2: ngrok
1. Add your ngrok auth token in VibeTunnel settings
2. Enable ngrok tunneling
3. Share the generated URL for remote access

### Option 3: Local Network
1. Set a dashboard password in settings
2. Switch to "Network" mode
3. Access via `http://[your-mac-ip]:4020`

### Command Options

```bash
# Claude-specific shortcuts
vt --claude              # Auto-locate and run Claude
vt --claude-yolo         # Run Claude with dangerous permissions

# Shell options
vt --shell               # Launch interactive shell
vt -i                    # Short form for --shell

# Direct execution (bypasses shell aliases)
vt -S ls -la            # Execute without shell wrapper
```

### Configuration

Access settings through the menu bar icon:
- **Server Port**: Change the default port (4020)
- **Launch at Login**: Start VibeTunnel automatically
- **Show in Dock**: Toggle between menu bar only or dock icon
- **Server Mode**: Switch between Rust (default) or Swift backend

## Architecture

VibeTunnel is built with a modern, secure architecture:
- **Native macOS app** written in Swift/SwiftUI
- **High-performance Rust server** for terminal management
- **Web interface** with real-time terminal rendering
- **Secure tunneling** via Tailscale or ngrok

For technical details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install via [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)
  ```bash
  # After installing Rust, add the x86_64 target for universal binary support
  rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
  ```
- **Node.js**: Required for building the web frontend

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel.git
cd vibetunnel

# Build the Rust server
cd tty-fwd && cargo build --release && cd ..

# Build the web frontend
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Open in Xcode
open VibeTunnel.xcodeproj
```

## Local Development Setup

For local development, configure your development team ID in `Local.xcconfig`. Without this, you'll face repeated permission and keychain dialogs, especially with ad-hoc installations. With proper code signing, these dialogs only appear on first launch.

To get your team ID:
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Then copy `Local.xcconfig.template` to `Local.xcconfig` and insert your team ID. This file is gitignored to keep your personal settings private.
